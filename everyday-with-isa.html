        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_blank">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially <br>
        if you've never been. Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide and <br>
        make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and<br>
        following your gut, you'll have an unforgettable experience!

    <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>
    <p>
        If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But <br>
        I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you <br>
        out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a <br>
        schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about <br>
        blowing your cash the whole time you won't have fun. Then check out<br>
        prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most.<br>
        Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!

    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>
    <p>
        Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be<br>
        uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is <br>
        about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen <br>
        to express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes <br>
        you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but <br>
        you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
